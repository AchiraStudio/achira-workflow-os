## ✨ Why Achira OS?

Most AI tools just "code." Achira **thinks**, **architects**, and **verifies**.

- 🧠 **Socratic Discovery**: Mandatory discovery layers that prevent architectural debt before a single file is created.
- 🎨 **Deep Design Thinking**: Built-in design intelligence that rejects generic templates in favor of premium, high-contrast UI/UX. No magic numbers, only tokens.
- 🛡️ **Mission-Critical Integrity**: A multi-layered verification engine (Security → Lint → Tests → UX) ensuring every commit is production-ready.
- 🚀 **Standardized Excellence**: Strict enforcement of Clean Code, Accessibility (a11y), and Performance guidelines across all projects.
- 🌍 **Native Mastery**: Powered by **7 internal Expert Pillars** distilling thousands of rules for web, app, game, ai, and devops engineering into zero-latency core knowledge.

## 🏗️ Installation

Achira Workflow OS is designed to be globally accessible.

### 1. Install via NPM

Deploy the CLI tools to your system:

```bash
npm install -g achira-wf
```

### 2. Initialize in Your Project

Navigate to any project directory and inject the OS:

```bash
achira-wf init
```

_This command installs the agents, skills, and workflows into a `.achira` directory, bundles relevant awesome-skills, and syncs slash commands for IDE discovery._

## 🚀 One-Click Scaffolding

Achira Workflow OS enables high-performance scaffolding directly through your AI assistant. Once `achira-wf init` is run, all templates become available as **slash commands** in your IDE.

```bash
# Web Foundations
/react          # React + Vite SPA
/next           # Next.js App Router (Fullstack)
/html           # Vanilla HTML + CSS + JS (Vite)

# Verticals
/saas           # Next.js + Supabase Auth/DB + Stripe
/landing-page   # SEO-Optimized Marketing Page

# Apps & Desktop
